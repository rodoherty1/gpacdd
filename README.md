# GPAC Dementia Defender

GPAC Dementia Defender is a pacman clone which I created for the Commodore 64.

I documented the whole process on the [Pac-clone playlist on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGeOqTSC9XBupZXtG7pxnjS_FIqzc5YMd)

This repo is a collection of all the source which I produced throughout the entire project.

The game (.prg file and manual) can be downloaded at http://tiny.cc/gpacdd
